## üì± Technology Implementation

### Mobile App Features
```javascript
// Emergency panic button
function triggerPanicButton() {
    // Send emergency alert with location
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
        sendEmergencyAlert({
            location: position.coords,
            timestamp: new Date(),
            agent_id: currentUser.id
        });
    });
}

// Real-time verification
async function verifyIdentity() {
    const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true });
    // Capture selfie with ID
    // Send to backend for verification
}

// Location tracking
function startLocationTracking() {
    navigator.geolocation.watchPosition((position) => {
        updateLocation(position.coords);
    }, { enableHighAccuracy: true });
}
```

### Backend Security
```python
# Document verification
def verify_document(document_data, document_type):
    # OCR extraction
    extracted_data = extract_text_from_image(document_data)
    
    # Validation
    if document_type == 'driving_license':
        return validate_driving_license(extracted_data)
    elif document_type == 'id_card':
        return validate_id_card(extracted_data)
    
    return False

# Face matching
def match_faces(selfie_data, id_photo_data):
    # Use facial recognition API
    similarity_score = compare_faces(selfie_data, id_photo_data)
    return similarity_score > 0.8  # 80% similarity threshold
```
