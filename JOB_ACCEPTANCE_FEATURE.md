# Job Acceptance Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented the ability for Delivery Agents to accept available delivery jobs.

## Backend Changes

### File: `potluck/backend/routes/delivery.py`
**New Endpoint:** `POST /api/delivery/accept-job/<order_id>`

**Functionality:**
1. Validates that the order exists and is a delivery order
2. Checks that the order hasn't already been assigned to another DA
3. Verifies the order status is 'accepted', 'preparing', or 'ready'
4. Assigns the delivery agent to the order by updating `delivery_agent_id`
5. Creates notifications for:
   - **Chef:** "Delivery Agent Assigned"
   - **Consumer:** "Delivery Agent On The Way"
6. Returns success/error response

**Security:**
- Uses `@require_auth` decorator to ensure only authenticated DAs can accept jobs
- Validates order availability before assignment

## Frontend Changes

### File: `potluck/frontend/js/delivery.js`
**New Function:** `acceptJob(orderId)`

**Functionality:**
1. Retrieves authentication token from localStorage
2. Sends POST request to `/api/delivery/accept-job/{orderId}`
3. Displays success toast notification on acceptance
4. Reloads available jobs list (job disappears)
5. Reloads active orders list (job appears there)
6. Handles errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

**Global Exposure:**
- Function is exposed to `window.acceptJob` for HTML onclick handlers

### File: `potluck/frontend/pages/delivery-dashboard.html`
**Cache Busting:** Updated version to `202510190330_ACCEPT`

## User Flow

### Before Acceptance:
1. DA logs in and sees available jobs
2. Each job shows:
   - Order number
   - Chef location and distance
   - Customer location and distance
   - ETA/Status
   - Estimated earnings
   - **"‚úì Accept Job"** button

### After Acceptance:
1. DA clicks "‚úì Accept Job" button
2. Success toast appears: "Job accepted successfully! üéâ"
3. Job disappears from "Available Jobs" section
4. Job appears in "Active Orders" section
5. Chef receives notification
6. Consumer receives notification

## Database Updates

**Table:** `orders`
- Sets `delivery_agent_id` to the accepting DA's user ID

**Table:** `notifications`
- Creates two new notification records (one for chef, one for consumer)

## Testing

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as DA (Tom Johnson)
2. Verify available jobs are displayed
3. Click "‚úì Accept Job" on POT-20251018-0008
4. Verify success toast appears
5. Verify job disappears from available jobs
6. Verify job appears in active orders
7. (Optional) Check chef/consumer dashboards for notifications

## Next Steps in Delivery Flow

After acceptance, the DA workflow continues:
1. ‚úÖ **Job Accepted** ‚Üê We are here
2. ‚è≥ Navigate to chef location
3. ‚è≥ Mark as "Picked Up"
4. ‚è≥ Navigate to customer location
5. ‚è≥ Mark as "Delivered"
6. ‚è≥ Receive rating & tip from customer

## Error Handling

**Possible Errors:**
- Order not found (404)
- Order already assigned (400)
- Order not available for pickup (400)
- Authentication failure (401)
- Server error (500)

All errors display user-friendly toast notifications.
