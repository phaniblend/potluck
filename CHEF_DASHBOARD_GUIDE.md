## 🤖 AI Price Advisor Details

### How It Works

1. **Chef fills in dish details**
   - Name: "Paneer Tikka Masala"
   - Cuisine: Indian
   - Ingredients: "paneer, tomatoes, cream, spices"
   - Portion: "Serves 2"

2. **Clicks "AI Suggest"**

3. **AI calculates:**
   ```
   Ingredients: $5.00
   Utilities: $0.50
   Packaging: $0.50
   ─────────────────
   Base Cost: $6.00
   
   Profit Margin (30%): $1.80
   Subtotal: $7.80
   
   Platform Fee (10%): $0.78
   ─────────────────
   Recommended Price: $8.58
   ```

4. **Chef sees 3 options:**
   - Min: $7.20 (safe pricing)
   - Recommended: $8.58 (optimal)
   - Max: $9.90 (premium)

5. **One-click to use any price**

### Why This is Valuable

- **No more guesswork** - Data-driven pricing
- **Competitive** - Based on actual costs, not restaurant prices
- **Profitable** - Ensures healthy margins
- **Transparent** - Shows exactly where money goes
- **Educational** - Teaches pricing strategy

### Pricing Philosophy

**❌ WRONG:** "Restaurants charge $20, so I'll charge $15"
**✅ RIGHT:** "My costs are $6, with 30% margin = $8.58"

This keeps homemade food affordable while ensuring chef profitability.
