Test Accounts (all passwords: password123)
- Consumer: john.doe@email.com
- Chef (Raj): raj.chef@email.com
- Delivery Agent: mike.driver@email.com

Seeded Data (for this flow)
- Chef Raj Patel, Dallas 75204 (321 Curry St)
- Consumer address to use: 123 Main St, Dallas, TX 75201
- DA Mike has service areas; if the list is empty, add the two below (see Step 3)

What you will demonstrate (5–10 minutes)
1) Consumer places a delivery order
2) Chef accepts with ETA and then marks Ready
3) Delivery Agent accepts, picks up, and delivers
4) Consumer verifies in Order History

Step-by-Step Instructions

1) Consumer – place a delivery order
   - Visit https://www.potluck.cafe and log in as Consumer (john.doe@email.com).
   - Browse dishes from Chef Raj (e.g., Vegetable Biryani) and add 1 item to the cart.
   - Open the cart (top-right) → Proceed to Checkout.
   - Delivery type: Delivery.
   - Delivery address: 123 Main St, Dallas, TX 75201.
   - Place Order and note the order number (POT-YYYYMMDD-####).
   - Logout.

2) Chef – accept with ETA, then mark Ready
   - Log in as Chef Raj (raj.chef@email.com).
   - Go to Orders → Pending; select the new order from John Doe.
   - Click Accept and enter an ETA in minutes (e.g., 20). This also notifies nearby DAs.
   - When you’re ready to continue, click Mark as Ready (order moves to Ready state).
   - Logout.

3) Delivery Agent – accept, pick up, deliver
   - Log in as Delivery Agent (mike.driver@email.com).
   - If My Service Areas is empty, add:
     • Uptown – ZIP 75204 – Dallas, TX, US (set Primary)
     • Downtown Dallas – ZIP 75201 – Dallas, TX, US
   - Ensure On shift toggle is ON and click Refresh.
   - Available Delivery Jobs: accept John Doe’s order (if Ready already, it may appear directly under Active Orders).
   - In Active Orders:
     • Mark as Picked Up (allowed only when the chef has marked Ready).
     • Optionally click Navigate to Customer to open Google Maps.
     • Mark as Delivered.
   - Logout.

4) Consumer – verify delivery
   - Log in as Consumer again.
   - Open Order History; confirm the order shows Delivered.
   - (Optional) Rate the order.

Gotchas / Tips to ensure a smooth demo
- If Available Jobs shows none:
  • Confirm the chef accepted with an ETA AND the order type was Delivery (not Pickup).
  • Make sure the DA has service areas that include the chef/consumer ZIPs (75204 and 75201).
  • Verify the DA On shift toggle is ON and click Refresh.
- Status rules enforced by backend:
  • DA can pick up only when order_status = ready.
  • DA can deliver only after order_status = picked_up.
- If UI looks stale or styles seem cached: hard refresh the page.
- If you just switched users in the same browser and see odd behavior: logout, then hard refresh or use an incognito window (avoids token caching).

What’s included in this MVP
- Consumer: browse/search, cart/checkout, order history (ratings scaffold).
- Chef: view/accept with ETA, preparing/ready status, notifications to DAs on accept.
- Delivery Agent: service areas, available jobs (proximity sorting), active orders, pickup/delivery.
- Distances and ETA calculation (Haversine), notifications for new delivery jobs.

Planned nice-to-have additions (near-term roadmap)
- In-app toast notifications everywhere (remove any remaining alerts), plus push notifications (mobile/PWA via FCM).
- Payments and tips (Stripe), and automated payouts.
- Rich menus (images, inventory windows, availability scheduling, variants/add-ons).
- Improved reordering and favorites, recommendations by cuisine/preference.
- DA navigation deep-links, route optimization, and batching.
- Stronger localization: language/currency/region sync, better AI translations.
- Admin/ops dashboards (moderation, support tooling, metrics).
