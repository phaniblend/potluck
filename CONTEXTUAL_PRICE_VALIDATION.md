## 💻 Technical Details

### Backend Changes (`routes/chef.py`)

```python
# Detects expensive ingredients
expensive_ingredients = ['caviar', 'truffle', 'lobster', 
                        'wagyu', 'saffron', 'kobe', 'foie gras']
has_expensive = any(exp_ing in ingredients for exp_ing in expensive_ingredients)

# Creates contextual message
if has_expensive:
    explanation = f"While {dish_name} contains premium ingredients, 
                   ${price} is still significantly above market rates 
                   for homemade food."
else:
    explanation = f"${price} for {dish_name} ({ingredients}) 
                   is {percent}% above typical market rates."

# Returns detailed rejection
return {
    'price_rejection': {
        'dish_name': dish_name,
        'your_price': price,
        'suggested': suggested_price,
        'max': max_price,
        'explanation': explanation,
        'breakdown': { ... },
        'has_premium_ingredients': has_expensive,
        'reasoning': ai_reasoning
    }
}
```

    // Displays premium badge if applicable
    // Shows cost breakdown
    // Provides action buttons
}

function useSuggestedPrice(price) { ... }
